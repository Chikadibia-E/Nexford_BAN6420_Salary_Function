# Employee Salary Data Processing

## Description
This project aims to process employee salary data, handle errors, and export employee details to a CSV file within a zipped folder. Additionally, it includes an R script to unzip and display the data.

## Instructions

1. Run Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda, and ensure Python 3.x and the latest version of R on the Jupyter environment.
2. **Import required Python modules**: os, pandas and zipfile.
3. Set a working directory and ensure the CSV file is in the working directory.
4. **Import Data**: Ensure the salary data file is in the working directory.
5. **Read CSV to Jupyter lab**: Use Pandas to read salary data .csv in the Jupyter environment.
6. **Create Employee Function with Error Handling**: Use the `employee_details` function, with try and except error handling, to retrieve employee details and test the function afterwards.
7. **Process Salary_data to dictionary**: Process the salary data converting it to a dictionary.
8. **Create Function to Export Employee Details**: Use the `export_employee_details` function, with error handling, to export and zip employee details. Test the function afterwards.
9. Open a new Jupyter launcher with R kernel.
10. **Unzip and Display Data with R**: Run R script to unzip and display the data.
